This script cooks food on the range north of the bank in Al Kharid.

- Requirements:
  - You MUST have a Staff of Water equipped. This is how the bot detects when cooking has finished.
  - Your bank PIN must have already been entered.
  - The door to the building with the range must be open.
  - Empty bank placeholders of the food item you wish to cook must not be visible when opening the bank. This could confuse the bot's image matching, as it may attempt to withdrawal the desired item by clicking on the empty placeholder.
