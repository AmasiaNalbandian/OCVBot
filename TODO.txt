IN PROGRESS:
- 0.2: Player walking.

PLANNED:
- Integrate with Travis-CI to test version and OS compatibility.
- Add GIFs and images to README.
- Create three basic functions to test speed of template matching methods: pyautogui, opencv (test all 6 methods), and sickig-image
  - produce output like "pyautogui completed in XX miliseconds, opencv method 1 completed in XX miliseconds ..."
- Add a "terminology.md" file to the docs/ dir to describe terms like
  "needle" and "haystack."
- Create unit tests for basic low-level functions, such as those in
  input.py.
    - make tests playform-independent by removing dependence on Feh for
      image viewing.
- GUI with PySimpleGUI.
